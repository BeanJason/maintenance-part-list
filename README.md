# maintenance-part-list
-- A website I began making for my internship at plastic omnium. The project was scrapped early in development after a software update to an existing software we were using made it obsolete. The goal of the software was to allow our maintenance team to store the what parts they need and for what line into a database. --

The website is built using node.js, javascript, express, css, and HTML using XAMPP to run an apache server as well as a MySQL database

In order to run first you must have node installed on your machine. When before running the code run nmp init. Once ran you should be able to start the front end server by navigating to the public folder and running "http-server ." this should give a message saying that it is available on port 8081.

Now we can start our backend by opening a seperate terminal and running the command "node ." on the entire entire maintenance-part-list folder. After running this a message should appear saying "listening on port 3000" and "connected to MySQL" as long as you remembered to start the apache server as well as the MySQL db in XAMPP.
